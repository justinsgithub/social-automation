Ruby and Vue code to show Two Barrels 

## projects 

I created 3 different projects to help show my capabilities and also get more experience with the Ruby and Vue ecosystem

Most of my front end experience is with ReactJS (Typescript) and its ecosystem, such as NextJS and Material-UI, but had not used Vue much beyond a simple todo app
